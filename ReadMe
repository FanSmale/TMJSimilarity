What are Triangle multiplying Jaccard (TMJ)?
1. TMJ similarity is desired to provie better prediction ability for recommender system.
2. The Triangle similarity considers both the length and the angle of rating vectors between them, while the Jaccard similarity considers non co-rating users. Therefore TMJ can take advantages of both Triangle and Jaccard similarities.
3. By comparing experimental results with eight state-of-the-art ones on four popular datasets under the leave-one-out scenario, results show that the new measure outperforms all the counterparts in terms of MAE and RSME.
